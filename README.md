# Azure Pipelines Cobertura Transform
Azure Pipelines task for transforming Cobertura 3 report files to Cobertura 4 format.

Azure Pipelines supports publishing Coverage results using the Cobertura format, but only Cobertura 4. Many coverage engines (especially for native code) still emit results in Cobertura 3 format. This extension provides a task that can create a Cobertura 4 formatted results file from a Cobertura 3 results file so that you can publish your Coverage results.

Functional but definitely still in an early Beta/Preview.
